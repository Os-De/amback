Important: Update Webpack and Yarn
The virus usually targets these files to reinstall itself randomly within scripts. Reinstall webpack and yarn to prevent the script from spreading.

Keep an eye on github github.com/Os-De/amback  for new software that update your Yarn/Webpack files automaticly in the near future.
